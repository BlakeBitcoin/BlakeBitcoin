Forked from Bitcoin reference wallet 0.8.6, Blakecoin and Photon

BlakeBitcoin is a cryptocurrency designed to use the Blake 256 algorithm cloned from Blakecoin and Photon.

Blake-256(optimized) is faster than Scrypt, SHA-256D, Keccak, Groestl

The algorithm was written as a candidate for sha3, Based on round one candidate code from the sphlib 2.1 and reduced rounds to 8.

Tweaks Removed some of the double hashing from the wallet as it is wasteful on compute, No changes to the ecdsa public/private function as that has proven to be secure so far on bitcoin.


What is Blakecoin?

Blakecoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Blakecoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing of coins are carried
out collectively by the network.

What is Photon ?

A clone of Blakecoin with a few changes.
The standard block award of Photon is 32,768 BUT as the block chain grows the award will increase.
The amount it increases is directly related to the current difficulty and height of the blockchain.
Miners will get 32,768 coins plus the square root of blockchain height multiplied by the current difficulty.
Still as Photon's are plentiful in the universe the max money is set to 90,000,000,000
That is 90 Billion Photons. Difficulty retargets every 20 blocks with a target of a new block to be produced every 3 minutes.
Up to block 3500 the max adjustment is 15% up each retarget.
After block 3500 the max adjustment is 3% up each retarget.

What is BlakeBitcoin?

A Clone of Bitcoin same reward structure Starting with 50 coins per block and a total of 21 million coins 
The Block target time is 1/4 of Bitcoin's to account for extra hashing speed of Blake-256
The difficulty retarget is at 8064 blocks and the reward halving every 210,000 blocks ~ 1 year
The difficulty ajustment is also same as per Bitcoin
